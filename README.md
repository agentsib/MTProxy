# MTProxy
Simple MT-Proto proxy
Modified from the [official version](https://github.com/TelegramMessenger/MTProxy), reducing some (huge) unreasonable resource usage.

*There may be a risk of instability, which has not been encountered so far, but because I did not interpret the logic of the entire project, the changes to this branch may cause errors.*

## Building
Install dependencies, you would need common set of tools for building from source, and development packages for `openssl` and `zlib`.

On Debian/Ubuntu:
```bash
apt install git curl build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev
```
On CentOS/RHEL:
```bash
yum install openssl-devel zlib-devel
yum groupinstall "Development Tools"
```

Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YanceyChiew/MTProxy
cd MTProxy
```

To build, simply run `make`, the binary will be in `objs/bin/mtproto-proxy`:

```bash
make && cd objs/bin
```

If the build has failed, you should run `make clean` before building it again.

## Running
1. Obtain a secret, used to connect to telegram servers.
```bash
curl -s https://core.telegram.org/getProxySecret -o proxy-secret
```
2. Obtain current telegram configuration. It can change (occasionally), so we encourage you to update it once per day.
```bash
curl -s https://core.telegram.org/getProxyConfig -o proxy-multi.conf
```
3. Generate a secret to be used by users to connect to your proxy.
```bash
head -c 16 /dev/urandom | xxd -ps
```
4. Run `mtproto-proxy`:
```bash
./mtproto-proxy -D '<fake-tls domain>' -u nobody -p 8888 -H 443 -S <secret> --aes-pwd proxy-secret proxy-multi.conf --multithread --epoll-timeout -1
```
... where:
- `<fake-tls domain>` is a domain name you would like to fake, in this way, blocking methods based on sni sniffing can be defended during tls handshake. This option is optional, if have set, the secret field of the client needs in a special format.
- `nobody` is the username. `mtproto-proxy` calls `setuid()` to drop privileges.
- `443` is the port, used by clients to connect to the proxy.
- `8888` is the local port. You can use it to get statistics from `mtproto-proxy`. Like `wget localhost:8888/stats`. You can only get this stat via loopback.
- `<secret>` is the secret generated at step 3. Also you can set multiple secrets: `-S <secret1> -S <secret2>`.
- `proxy-secret` and `proxy-multi.conf` are obtained at steps 1 and 2.
- `multithread` is for switching to multi-threaded mode, to make better use of computer resources.
- `epoll-timeout` is the timeout period for reading network responses, in ms. Setting it to -1 means blocking calls, which saves resources the most. Currently only effective in multi-threaded mode, for single-threaded timeout it is actually 1ms.

Also feel free to check out other options using `mtproto-proxy --help`.

5. Generate the link with following schema: `tg://proxy?server=SERVER_NAME&port=PORT&secret=SECRET` (or let the official bot generate it for you).
6. Register your proxy with [@MTProxybot](https://t.me/MTProxybot) on Telegram.
7. Set received tag with arguments: `-P <proxy tag>`
8. Enjoy.

## Random padding
Due to some ISPs detecting MTProxy by packet sizes, random padding is
added to packets if such mode is enabled.

It's only enabled for clients which request it.

Add `dd` prefix to secret (`cafe...babe` => `ddcafe...babe`) to enable
this mode on client side.

## Fake tls
Some area block MTProxy by active detection, fake-tls can forward illegal detection packets to a real web server to hide mtproto packets.
To use it, specify the domain name you want to disguise through the -D option, then run the following command:
```bash
echo -n '<fake-tls domain>' | xxd -ps
```
Now you have the hexadecimal form of the domain name, splicing it with the secret field generated above like:
`ee<secret><the hexadecimal form of the domain name>`
is the secret used by the client.

## Systemd example configuration

0. Copy all files in the current directory (objs/bin) to /opt/MTProxy:
```bash
mkdir -p /opt/MTProxy && cp * -t /opt/MTProxy
```
1. Create systemd service file (it's standard path for the most Linux distros, but you should check it before):
```bash
nano /etc/systemd/system/MTProxy.service
```
2. Edit this basic service (especially paths and params):
```bash
[Unit]
Description=MTProxy
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
WorkingDirectory=/opt/MTProxy
ExecStart=/opt/MTProxy/mtproto-proxy -D '<fake-tls domain>' -u nobody -p 8888 -H 443 -S <secret> --aes-pwd proxy-secret proxy-multi.conf --multithread --epoll-timeout -1
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
3. Reload daemons:
```bash
systemctl daemon-reload
```
4. Test fresh MTProxy service:
```bash
systemctl restart MTProxy.service
# Check status, it should be active
systemctl status MTProxy.service
```
5. Enable it, to autostart service after reboot:
```bash
systemctl enable MTProxy.service
```

## Docker image
Telegram is also providing [official Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/telegrammessenger/proxy/).
Note: the image is outdated.
